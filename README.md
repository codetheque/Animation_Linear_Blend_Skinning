Computer Animation
===============================

This repository contains my assignments (or parts of them, I have not published all the code) for the Computer Animation course, taken in Fall 2013. In one of the assignments, I implemented a program that animates a character using motion captured data and linear blend skinning. The skeleton data, blending weights and animation were created using the Pinocchio library (http://www.mit.edu/~ibaran/autorig/).
